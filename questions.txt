one general question i ll have concerning raytraced voxels would be : how to get rid of the pixelated / noisy look and get a smooth look?
--glasz

is that technology, voxels, is just for gaming, rendering?. what other real applications can use it? --necati

is there any advantage of oberon here compared to other languages, C++/java/ and others, i.e, why you have chosen the oberon lang. what is your road map for this project? --necati

uh could you define rasterization plz for the pleb viewer 
can you explain exactly what is wrong with the whole air-solid potentially visible thing? why is that not efficient or something --nsnoox


ok one question I had was, have you done any integrative work with the LLUDP (Linden UDP protocol) stack? 
can you do any sort of viewer type experience on, say, an opensim, or sl?or even minecraft for that matter or WoW LOL --Hiro_Protagonist

... so far the only question I have is whether you have or have thought about support for CSG operations yet? 
And that is probably not the sort of question you are after? --immortius
